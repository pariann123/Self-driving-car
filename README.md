# Self-driving-car
Training a deep learning algorithm to autonomously navigate a real car around a realistic test circuit, and make the appropriate manoeuvres where necessary.

Deep learning model takes images from the car camera to predict the appropriate speed and steering angle. Training data consists of 13.8k images, along with the target car responses (speed and steering angle).

The main body of the car is the SunFounder PiCar-V kit V2 (https://www.sunfounder.com/smart-video-car-kit-v2-0.html), and is equipped with a Raspberry Pi (RPi) 4.
