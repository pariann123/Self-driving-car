# Self-driving-car
Training a deep learning algorithm to autonomously navigate a real car around a realistic test circuit, and make the appropriate manoeuvres where necessary.

Developed a deep learning model that takes an image from a camera on the car, and predicts the appropriate speed and steering angle.

Training data consisted of 13.8k images, along with the target carresponse (speed and steering angle).

The main body of the car is the SunFounder PiCar-V kit V2 (https://www.sunfounder.com/smart-video-car-kit-v2-0.html), and is equipped with a Raspberry Pi (RPi) 4.
